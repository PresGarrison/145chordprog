# 1-4-5 Chord Progression Generator

## About

This little app is designed to help beginner musicians who may have trouble with key signatures. Its a basic input/output little thing. 

> *ie. if you input A, it displays D as the IV chord and G as the V chord.*

Unfortunately, I have neglected to figure out how to add the sharp and flat keys. I'll figure it out eventually. 

It's written in HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4 & jQuery. You shouldn't need anything fancy to open it up. 

It also has gibberish/an about page when you click the numbers at the top of container.
